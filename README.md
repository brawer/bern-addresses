# Bern Address Book

Address books of the City of Bern, published from 1861 to 1940.

The printed volumes have been scanned and are published on e-rara.ch.
However, the OCR quality was rather low. We re-OCRed the scanned images
and did (lot of) cleanup to bring the address book into a structured form.
For example, the printed books were full of abbreviations, which we expanded;
in 1882, many streets were renamed and most houses were renumbered, so
(to the extent possible) we map them to their present-day equivalent;
and we assign a [numeric CH-ISCO-19 code](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/work-income/nomenclatures/ch-isco-19.html) to every person’s
listed occupation. The long-term goal is to support research projects
that need quantitative data.

As of November 2024, this is still an ongoing project. From time to time,
we publish a fresh release. To download the latest released version, go to
[Releases](https://github.com/brawer/bern-addresses/releases/latest)
