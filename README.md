# Bern Address Book

Address books of the City of Bern, published from 1860 to 1945.

The printed volumes have been scanned and are published online at
[e-rara.ch](https://www.e-rara.ch/bes_1/periodical/titleinfo/1395833).
However, the OCR quality is rather low. We re-OCRed the scanned images
and did (lots of) cleanup to bring the address book into a structured form.
For example, the printed books were full of abbreviations; we expanded them.
In 1882, many streets were renamed and most house numbers changed; we map
them (to the extent possible) to their present-day equivalents.
We assigned a [numeric CH-ISCO-19 code](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/work-income/nomenclatures/ch-isco-19.html) to every person’s
listed occupation. The long-term goal is to support research projects
that analyze quantitative data, but it would be nice to also have a
cute website for browsing the historic address book.

As of November 2025, this is still an ongoing project; we’ve only done
two volumes so far.  From time to time, we publish a fresh release. To
download the latest, take the file `Berner_Adressbuch.zip` from our
[Releases page](https://github.com/brawer/bern-addresses/releases/latest).
